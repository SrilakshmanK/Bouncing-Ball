# Bouncing Balls

This project creates a set of colorful bouncing balls that move randomly within the browser window. The balls bounce off the edges of the screen and change direction accordingly. The animation is achieved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Multiple Balls**: 10 balls are randomly generated with different colors, positions, and velocities.
- **Bouncing Animation**: The balls bounce off the edges of the browser window.
- **Smooth Movement**: The animation runs smoothly using `requestAnimationFrame` for each frame.

## How It Works

1. **Ball Creation**: The program generates 10 balls when the page is loaded. Each ball is represented by a `div` with a circular shape.
2. **Random Properties**: Each ball has random initial position (`x`, `y`), velocity (`xvel`, `yvel`), and color. These are generated by helper functions.
3. **Movement Logic**: The balls move in random directions and bounce off the window edges when they hit the boundaries.
4. **Collision Detection
